# kubectl gke

This `kubectl` plugin effectively replaces the `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` command, allowing for more
choice while avoiding annoyances such as changing the current context when adding new contexts. It also uses its own
authentication mechanism for `kubectl`, removing the dependency on `gcloud` altogether.

_Why would I use this plugin?_

* Do you have a lot of GKE clusters in the same Google Cloud Platform project?
* Do you dislike the verbosity of the Kubernetes contexts generated by `gcloud`?
* Do you want to update your cluster details independent of your contexts?
* Do you switch between contexts often, and are encumbered by `gcloud` having to fetch new credentials each time?

If your answer is yes to either of those questions, `kubectl gke` might be for you!

## Example usage

```sh
kubectl gke get-credentials $PROJECT \
    --selector env=production,tier!=foo \
    --format '{{ .Cluster.Name }}'
```

or equivalently

```sh
kubectl gke get-credentials $PROJECT -lenv=production,tier!=foo -f'{{ .Cluster.Name }}'
```

or equivalently

```sh
export KUBECTL_GKE_CONTEXT_FORMAT='{{ .Cluster.Name }}'
kubectl gke get-credentials $PROJECT -lenv=production,tier!=foo
```

## Installation

To install `kubectl gke`, run the following outside of a Go module:

```sh
env GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/fsommar/kubectl-gke
```

To verify that it's working as expected, run `kubectl gke --help`.
